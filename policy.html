                        <h3>Firebase by Google
                        </h3>

                        <p>We use the Firebase service from Google LLC. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA) in order to derive application behavioral analytics in Germany. We use that information to see how users interact with our website and app.
                        </p>

                        <p>Firebase is part of the Google Cloud Platform and offers numerous services for developers. A list can be found here: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/terms/</a>. Some Firebase services process personal data. In most cases, the personal data is limited to so-called “instance IDs”, which are provided with a time stamp. These “Instance IDs” assigned by Firebase are unique and thus allow the linking of different events or processes. This data does not represent personally identifiable information for us, nor do we make any efforts to personalize it subsequently. We process these aggregated data to analyze and optimize usage behavior, for example by evaluating crash reports.
                        </p>

                        <p>Currently, we use the following Firebase services:
                        </p>

                        <p>Google Analytics for Firebase: Google Analytics uses the data to provide analytics and attribution information. The precise information collected can vary by the device and environment. You can find more information via this link: <a href="https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6318039" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6318039</a>. 
                        </p>

                        <p>and on Google’s partner policy. Google Analytics retains ID-associated data for 60 days, and retains aggregate reporting and campaign data without automatic expiration, unless the Firebase customer changes their retention preference in their Analytics settings or deletes their project.For Analytics for Firebase, Google uses not only the “Instance ID” described above, but also the advertising ID of the end device. You can restrict the use of the advertising ID in the device settings of your mobile device. For android: Settings > Google > Ads > Reset Ad ID For iOS: Settings > Privacy > Advertising > No ad tracking
                        </p>

                        <h3>Am i Obliged To Provide Data?
                        </h3>

                        <p>The processing of your data is necessary for the conclusion or fulfillment of the contract you have entered into with us. If you do not provide us with this data, we will usually have to refuse to conclude the contract or will no longer be able to perform an existing contract and consequently have to terminate it. However, you are not obliged to give your consent to data processing with regard to data that is not relevant for the fulfillment of the contract or that is not required by law.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Disclosure of personal data to third parties
                        </h3>

                        <p>Your personal data will only be passed on if there is a legal obligation to do so or to service providers and partner companies that have been carefully selected in advance and are contractually obliged to comply with the requirements of data protection law.
                        </p>

                        <p>We pass on your personal data for the conclusion and processing of contracts for offers on our website to affiliated companies. This is particularly necessary so that you can use all our offers. 
                        </p>

                        <p>For the operation and optimization of our website and our services and for the processing of contracts, various service companies work for us, e.g. for central IT services or the hosting of our website, for the payment and delivery of products or for the dispatch of newsletters, to whom we pass on the data required for the fulfillment of the task (e.g. name, address).
                        </p>

                        <p>Some of these companies act for us by way of commissioned processing and may therefore use the data provided exclusively in accordance with our instructions. In this case, we are legally responsible for appropriate data protection precautions at the companies we commission. We therefore agree on specific data security measures with these companies and monitor them regularly.
                        </p>

                        <p>In contrast to order processing, in the following cases we transmit data to third parties for their own use in order to process the contract in the case of payment for goods to the payment service provider specified when the order was placed. 
                        </p>

                        <p>We do not collect or store any payment transaction information such as credit card numbers or bank details during the payment process. You only provide this information directly to the respective payment service provider. 
                        </p>

                        <p>We will disclose your data to third parties or government agencies within the framework of existing data protection laws if we are legally obliged to do so, e.g. due to official or court orders, or if we are entitled to do so, e.g. because this is necessary for the prosecution of criminal offenses or for the exercise and enforcement of our rights and claims.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Data transfer to third countries
                        </h3>

                        <p>If we use service providers in third countries, we take additional measures to ensure an adequate level of data protection for the transfer of personal data in accordance with Art. 44 of the GDPR and thus ensure that the transfer is generally permissible and that the special requirements for a transfer to a third country are met (e.g. by concluding EU standard contracts and additional guarantees, supplementary technical and organizational measures such as encryption or anonymization).
                        </p>

                        <h3>Do Not Track
                        </h3>

                        <p>Do Not Track is a privacy preference you can set in most browsers. We support Do Not Track because we believe that you should have genuine control over how your info gets used and our site responds to Do Not Track requests.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Do Not Sell My Personal Information 
                        </h3>

                        </p>

                        <h3>Accuracy</h3>

                        <p>It is important that the data we hold about you is accurate and current, therefore please keep us informed of any changes to your personal data.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Children Data
                        </h3>

                        <p>Our website is not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children. If you become aware that your Child has provided us with Personal Data, without parental consent, please contact us and we take the necessary steps to remove that information from our server.

                        </p>
