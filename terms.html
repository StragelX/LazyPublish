                        <h3>Account</h3>

                        <p>
                            In order to use our Service, you must 1) be at least (16 ) years old and able to enter into contracts; 2) complete the registration process; 3) agree to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement; and 4) provide true, complete, and up to date legal and contact information. If you sign up for LazyPublish on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to accept these Terms on their behalf.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Agreement Term
                        </h3>

                        <p>The term of the Agreement (the “Agreement Term”) begins when you sign up for LazyPublish or first use the Services and continues as long as you use the Services. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Account and Password
                        </h3>

                        <p>The Services are provided to Customer via a dedicated account on the Website, pursuant to which Customer will create a unique user-id and password.</p>

                        <p>You’re responsible for keeping your user-id and password confidential. You’re also responsible for any use of any account that you have access to, whether or not you authorized the use. You’ll immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your accounts.</p>

                        <p>You are solely responsible for any losses, damages, fees or liability due to your lost, stolen, hacked or otherwise compromised user-ids and passwords.</p>

                        <p>We don’t have access to your current password, and for security reasons, we may only reset your password.</p>

                        <h3>Fees, Payments
                        </h3>

                        <p>We provide both free and paid plan Services. Free plan and paid services are provided on per account basis.</p>

                        <p>All charges for the paid services (“Charges”) are posted on the Website, or otherwise set forth in the Agreement. You agree to pay for paid services according to these Terms. Charges paid by Customer are non-refundable.</p>

                        <p>The Services are a prepaid subscription service with recurring payments. Except to the extent otherwise set forth in an Order Form, the subscription automatically renews at the end of the paid period unless explicitly cancelled before the start of new billing period.</p>

                        <p> As long as you’re using paid services, you’ll provide LazyPublish’s third party payment processor with valid credit card information and authorize us to deduct the monthly charges against that credit card. You’ll replace the information for any credit card that expires with information for a different valid credit card. Anyone using a credit card represents and warrants that he or she is authorized to use that credit card, and that any and all charges may be billed to that credit card and won’t be rejected. If, for some reason, our third party payment processor is unable to process your credit card order, we’ll try to charge 3 more times in the next few days. Consecutive charge retries does not change and/or extend your monthly or annual renewal date.</p>

                        <p>
                            We may introduce new or cancel existing paid services and features at any time and change pricing from time to time. You will be informed about any of the changes at least one month in advance via email and/or on our Website.
                        </p>
